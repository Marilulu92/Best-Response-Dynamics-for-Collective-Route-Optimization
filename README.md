# Best-Response-Dynamics-for-Collective-Route-Optimization
This repository provides the experimental implementation of the Collective Optimization Scheme (COS) for traffic route generation, integrating Best Response Dynamics and Dijkstra’s algorithm with a congestion model to derive collaborative routing solutions and produce the required files for SUMO-based traffic simulation.
